Usually this means the stack call points to a module that was reflectively loaded in memory. Adding to this, it is not common to see such few calls in the stack (ntdll.dll --> kernelbase.dll --> unknown) which essentially means that most of the functions required by the process to execute certain routines are already present in memory, not requiring any calls to external libraries.
