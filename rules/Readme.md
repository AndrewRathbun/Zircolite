# Rulesets

These rulesets have been generated with `genRules.py` wich is available in the folder `tools` of the Zircolite repository.

:warning: **These rulesets are given "as is" to help new analysts to discover SIGMA and Zircolite. They are not filtered for slow rules, rules with a lot of false positives etc. If you know what you do, you MUST generate your own rulesets.**

- `rules_windows_generic.json` : Full SIGMA "**Windows**" ruleset (no SYSMON rewriting)
- `rules_windows_sysmon.json` : Full SIGMA "**Windows**" ruleset (SYSMON)
